# Battleship Style Game: "Sink a Dot Com"

<strong>Goal: </strong>Sink all of the computer's Dot Coms in fewest number of guesses

<strong>Setup: </strong>When the game program is launched, the computer places three Dot Coms on a virtual 7x7 grid. When that's complete the gae asks for your first guess. 

<strong>How you play: </strong>Computer will prompt you to enter a guess(cell), that you'll type at the command-line as "A3", "C5", etc. In response to your guess, you'll see a result at the command-line, either "Hit", "Miss", Or "you sank xyz.com"
When you've sent all three Dot coms to that big 404 in the sky the game ends by printing you rating.
